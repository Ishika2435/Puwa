Preparation:-

1. First we have mix mawa or milk powder in 1/4 cup slightly hot water or milk.
2. Stir to dissolve it.
3. Add flour, fennel seeds amd cardamom powder.
4. Add more milk as needed and make a batter. It may take up to 11/2 to 3/4 cup milk for the entire recipe.

Making sugar syrup:-

6. Mix together sugar and water in a pot.
7. Boil the syrup until it turns sticky or 1 string consistency.
8. Heat 3 cups water in a wide pot and place the syrup pot in  it to keep the syrup  warm and prevent crystallizing. Alternately you can just stir in 2 tsp lemon juice.

Puwa:-

9. Add 2 to 3 tbsps to a deep pan and heat it on a medium flame.
10. When the ghee turns hot, pour half ladle of batter about 2 to 3 tbsps.
11. Do not spread the batter. It spreads on it's own if it is of the right consistency.
12. When the edges turn golden, flip and fry.
13. If we make them with thin batter, then we will get them thin and only the edges turn crisp and golden but if we make them thick then, the puwa turns fluffy.
14. When the puwa is done, remove them from ghee and add to the syrup directly. Make sure to stir up the syrup well once berofe adding the puwa's.
15. Remove them to a wide plate.
16. And there we go that is the recipe for the puwa.
